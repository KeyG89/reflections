* When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- I would rather keep a remote repository in case of collaboration or working remotly from another computer.

* Why might you want to always pulll changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because I want to be sure, that my remote repository has only 100% valid code. Place for expermental changes and adding new features, fixing bugs, till are completely finished is on my local repository.

* Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another.

- Fork - is used to get an existing repository from github to your github account as a separated repo

- Clone - is used to get repo from github repository to your local machine

- Branch - is used to branch ;)

* What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

fast forward merging?

* How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? Wat would be easier, and what would be harder.

- collaboration through working in the same place, at the same time, easier to communicate about conflicts, harder in case of working in other place in another time

* When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I would be collaborating with other people and it would be a huge benefit.
